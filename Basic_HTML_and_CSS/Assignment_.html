				<h1>BEST CLIMBING CONDITIONS</h1>
				<p>
					The best conditions to climb in are the conditions in which a climber can perform the best.<br>
					This is for two reasons:<br>
					1: Safety!<br>
					2: Fun!<br>
					If a climber wants to be as safe as possible, they will climb in optimal conditions.<br>
					Example of bad conditions:<br>
					A climber wakes up at 3:00&nbsp;am<br>
					They are tired and decide it's a good idea to climb an easy route.<br>
					The climber starts climbing on an easy route.<br>
					Because they are climbing with a headlamp, they can't see very far.<br>
					The climber hears a rock falling from above but can't see it coming.<br>
					The climber doesn't know if they are going to be hit or if their rope will get cut.<br>
					The climbers belayer also doesn't know if the rock is going to hit them.<br>
					Both the climber and the belayer have chosen poor conditions to climb in.

				<h1 style="text-decoration:underline;">CHOOSING A PARTNER</h1>
				<p>
					The best way to choose a good climbing partner is to find one with more experience than yourself.<br>
					You probably don't want to find someone who is going to put you in high-risk situations either.<br>
					Because of the discrepancy in levels of experience, communication to the experienced climber is vital.<br>
					The things an experienced climber will consider high-risk and the things you consider high-risk will vary.<br>
					As a beginner, you may not be aware of the risk that surrounds you.<br>
					This is something to take into consideration if you are not comfortable, but your experienced partner is not.<br>
					Choosing terrain that is uncomfortable to you, but not to your partner is also something to consider.<br>
					You may feel like it's unsafe, but your partner may have the experience to help you see why it is safe.<br>
					Either way, communications between partners is vital, so try and communicate early and often when choosing a partner.
